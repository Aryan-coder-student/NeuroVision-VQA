## 🖥️ Frontend Implementation (⚠️ Under Maintenance)

The project's frontend is maintained in a separate repository by [OoONANCY](https://github.com/OoONANCY) and [ANSHIKA1220](https://github.com/ANSHIKA1220) for modular development and better maintenance. The frontend provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with both the VQA model and medical chatbot functionality.

### Frontend Repository

```
https://github.com/OoONANCY/Omkar_frontend
```

The frontend implementation offers:

- User-friendly interface for uploading images
- Interactive question input for VQA functionality
- Chat interface for medical queries
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Real-time display of model predictions and responses

To integrate the frontend with the API:

1. Clone the frontend repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OoONANCY/Omkar_frontend.git
cd Omkar_frontend
```

2. Install dependencies and run the frontend application
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

3. Ensure the Flask API is running at the expected endpoint (default: http://localhost:5000)

## 📥 Dataset Download  
The VQA-RAD dataset is available on Hugging Face: [flaviagiammarino/vqa-rad](https://huggingface.co/datasets/flaviagiammarino/vqa-rad).  
To download the **VQA-RAD** dataset from Hugging Face and store it in `data/bronze/`, run the following script:  

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("flaviagiammarino/vqa-rad")
dataset.save_to_disk("data/bronze/")
```

This ensures that your dataset is properly downloaded and stored in the `bronze` data layer. 🚀

This VQA model enables machines to understand and answer natural language questions about images. Leveraging the BLIP framework, it achieves high accuracy in interpreting visual content and generating relevant textual responses. The system is enhanced with a LangChain-powered agent for handling medical queries beyond image analysis.

## 🌐 API Architecture

### `app.py` - Flask API Implementation

The Flask API serves as the backbone of our deployment strategy, offering two primary endpoints:

1. **Image Question Answering (`/predict/`)**
   - Receives an image file and a question
   - Processes the image using the BLIP processor
   - Passes the processed inputs to the fine-tuned model
   - Returns the generated answer as a JSON response

2. **Medical Chatbot (`/chat/`)**
   - Accepts a text query related to medical topics
   - Forwards the query to a LangChain-powered agent
   - Returns comprehensive medical information from multiple sources

**Key Components:**
- **CORS Support**: Enables cross-origin requests for frontend integration
- **Environment Variables**: Securely loads API keys for external services
- **GPU/CPU Detection**: Automatically selects the appropriate device for model inference
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust exception handling for all endpoints

## 🤖 LangChain Agent System

Our system employs a sophisticated LangChain agent architecture to handle medical queries beyond image analysis:

### Agent Components

1. **Search Tools**
   - **Medical Web Search**: Utilizes SerpAPI to search the web for medical information related to brain, CT, and MRI scans
   - **PubMed Search**: Connects to PubMed API for accessing peer-reviewed medical research papers

2. **LLM Backend**
   - Powered by Groq's **Gemma2-9b-it** model for generating coherent and accurate responses
   - Configured for medical domain specialization

3. **Memory System**
   - Implements `ConversationBufferMemory` to maintain context across multiple queries
   - Enables follow-up questions and contextual understanding

4. **Agent Configuration**
   - Uses `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` agent type for reasoning capabilities
   - Limited to 10 iterations to ensure timely responses
   - Includes error handling for parsing issues

5. **Flow Process**
   - Receives user query via the `/chat/` endpoint
   - Agent analyzes the query and determines which tools to use
   - Searches appropriate sources (web or PubMed)
   - Synthesizes information into a comprehensive response
   - Returns formatted answer to the user

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### `Dockerfile`

The `Dockerfile` defines the containerized environment for deploying the VQA model. It installs all dependencies, copies source files, and sets up both the **Flask API** and **Streamlit UI**.

#### **Dockerfile Breakdown:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000 8501
CMD ["sh", "-c", "python Deployment/app.py & while ! nc -z localhost 5000; do sleep 1; done; streamlit run Deployment/streamlit/main.py --server.port=8501 --server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

#### **Build and Run Commands:**

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t vqa-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 -p 8501:8501 vqa-app
```

## 📡 API Documentation

### Predict Answer Endpoint

```bash
# Request format
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict/" \
  -F "file=@path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "question=What is in the image?"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "The image shows a brain MRI scan with a visible tumor in the temporal lobe"
}
```

### Chatbot Query Endpoint

```bash
# Request format
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is Astrocytoma?"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that develops from star-shaped cells called astrocytes. These cells are part of the glial tissue, which supports and protects neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytomas can range from slow-growing (low-grade) to aggressive (high-grade) tumors. They are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into four grades (I-IV), with grade IV being the most aggressive form, also known as glioblastoma multiforme. Symptoms may include headaches, seizures, memory problems, and changes in behavior, depending on the tumor's location and size. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, depending on the grade and location of the tumor."
}
```

### API Testing (`test_api.py`)

```python
import requests

# Test the chat endpoint
url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat/"
payload = {"query": "What is Astrocytoma?"}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(response.json())
```
